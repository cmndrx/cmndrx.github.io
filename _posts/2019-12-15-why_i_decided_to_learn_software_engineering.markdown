**Background**
For as long as I can remember, technology has been my passion. I have always considered myself a tech savvy person. I'm the guy who my friends and family come to when they need help troubleshooting their tech issues. A few years ago I thought it would be cool to learn a new language. I was considering spanish and had even found some software that seemed to help you learn the language fairly quickly. That's when my brother recommended I try to learn a programming language instead of a traditional spoken language. This was something I had never considered before but it immediately sparked my interest. 

**The Journey Begins**
After a few weeks of research I found that there were a ton of programming languages but ultimately decided that Java would be the language for me. This decision was based on the versatility of the Java programming language. I dove straight in immersing myself into the world of software engineering. I started by following a few different Youtube series and found that I was quickly learning the basic syntax for the Java programming language. 

**My First Project**
After about three months of following along with youtube videos I was eager to code something of my own. My first project was a basic android calculator app that could take input from a user and return the result. The calculator was very basic and only returned results for the sum, product, quotient, and difference. It took me roughly 10 hours to design and code the front-end and back-end logic. I was so proud of myself for actually creating something from scratch. This peaked my interest and led to me working on more small coding projects which helped me become comfortable with the Java programming language. Over the next few years I was able to experiment with more programming languages because of the fundamentals I learned working with Java. I was able to quickly pick up the  Kotlin, Swift, and Javascript programming languages. It seemed at this point my hunger for knowledge only continued to grow. 

**The Big Decision**
One day I thought it might be interesting to look into how much professional software engineers made a year and was blown away by the results. I decided it was time to get a mentor and I was long overdue for a career change seeing as I had a dead-end job. That's when I came across Flatiron school. I looked into the program and spoke to a recruiter for the school about the curriculum. Immediately I knew that their software engineering program was the next step in my journey to becoming a professional software engineer.
